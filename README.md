UFOs(Unidentified flying objects) It's an extremely fascinating phenomena. Almost everyone has heard stories related tho UFO sightings. From Independence day to Alien, there is plenty of movies, tv shows referencing this  type of events. Even though it is somewhat mainstream,  there are not that many official records of this. However, with the recent rise of 'Big Data' we have more information regarding UFOs.
In this project I try to answer these questions:

During what months most sightings happen?
When people report a sighting, how do dey describe them? What are the most common type of UFOs?
What cities have the most reported sightings?
At what time of the day are we more likely to encounter an UFO?

Note: Data used is for the year of 2016 and USA/Canada Only.
